`vendor/gpui-pre-windows` is gpui-pre-windows 0.3.9 with Ferrite patches (low-power GPU, drop target that reports keys and allowed effects, refuses targets without an app hint, and posts the native drag-source hook); its `src/gpui_windows.rs` header lists them.

## Coverage without rustup

On a system Rust without rustup (for example Arch's `rust` package), `cargo llvm-cov` needs `LLVM_COV=/usr/bin/llvm-cov` and `LLVM_PROFDATA=/usr/bin/llvm-profdata`. The system LLVM must match `rustc -vV` (LLVM 23.1.1 today). CI uses rustup and needs neither.

The drag bridge is wired through `StartOptions::drop_platform`. Windows registers the existing shell adapter before opening the window. Incoming sources are frozen without filesystem reads during hover. The app checks the source's allowed effects before planning a job; a right-button drop snapshots those permissions before showing the choice menu.

`rusty-ui-gallery --screenshot <dir> --pages p36-x3-drop-menu` captures the shared drop-menu items in both themes. GPUI's `TestAppContext::test_window` is private, so downstream tests cannot set native handoff acceptance or inspect its payload log. The row resolver, session cleanup, reentry and refresh are covered locally; actual OLE promotion, Explorer effects and source deletion behavior require Windows.
